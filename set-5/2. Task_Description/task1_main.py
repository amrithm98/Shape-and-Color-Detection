* ====================== GENERAL Instruction =======================
* 1. Check for "DO NOT EDIT" tags - make sure you do not change function name of main().
* 2. Return should be board_objects and output_list. Both should be list of tuple 
* 3. Do not keep uncessary print statement, imshow() functions in final submission that you submit
* 4. Do not change the file name
* 5. Your Program will be tested through code test suite designed and graded based on number of test cases passed

def main(board_filepath, container_filepath):
	'''
This function is the main program which takes image of game-board and
container as argument. Team is expected to insert their part of code as
required to solve the given task (function calls etc).

***DO NOT EDIT THE FUNCTION NAME. Leave it as main****
Function name: main()

******DO NOT EDIT name of these argument*******
Input argument: board_filepath and container_filepath.

Return: 
1 - List of tuples which is the expected final output. See Task1_Description for detail. 
2 - List of tuples for objects on board. See Task1_Description for detail.
